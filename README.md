Info
----
These are the dotfiles I use on most of the machines I deploy. They aren't special, but some people may find them useful. :)

Usage
-----
To use these dotfiles, simply run the following command in your home folder:

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rosspf/dotfiles.git
	$ mv dotfiles ~/.dotty
	$ python ~/.dotty/dotty/dotty.py ~/.dotty/dotty.rc
